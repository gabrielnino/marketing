Initiate interactive mode. You have to ask me one question at a time to clarify the goal, adapting according to my answers. Help improve the following prompt using the structure: Role, Context, Task, Format. The context for the prompt is the attached code. Your goal is to develop an interactive routine with steps one at a time; after each validation, you should not continue until the current step is correctly validated. This routine is to implement a feature that searches for viral videos on YouTube using the YouTube API, passes the results through an LLM using specific prompts, and utilizes the services of a validation factory.
